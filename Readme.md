Prerequisite
============
To run the scripts, the datasets and some open source tools need to be downloaded:

1. Datasets from SemEval-2014 Task 4: http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/index.php?id=data-and-tools and put in the evaluation folder.
2. word2vec and Google News Embeddings: https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/
3. Amazon Reviews: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html
4. SENNA Embeddings: http://ronan.collobert.com/senna/
Note that the Embeddings should be put in the embeddings folder.

Example Commands
================
Some example commands are as follows:

1. bash rnn-batch.sh Senna
2. bash cv-batch.sh laptop Senna 50 50
